##Inspiration
As teaching assistants for the Computer Sceince Department we found students not receivng the right help and at the right time to succeed.

##What it does
This app reduces the barriers between students who need help and those willing to help them, by introducing watson which tries to answer the student's question if a TA is absent and resents them solutions that increases their inquisitiveness.

##How we built it
A python flask application.

##Challenges we ran
Deployment, Learning how to use and train IBM-watson.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to use IBM's watson and put it together with a working prototype in less than 24 hours.

##What we learned
We learned about emerging technologies, and how to use IBM-watson

##What's next for Elementary
Add more subjects that students get help from and run a beta testing on our campus.
